# Developing a 3D Graphics Engine to Optimise Collision Detection using Fractal Geometry.

The project is to design a 3D graphics engine combining efficient fractal generation, rendering and storage with a
fractal-based collision detection and response algorithm. The engine must accept varying meshes of different mesh
counts and involves utilising object file formats, producing renders from different projections. Using the recursive
nature of fractals, it aims to exponentially reduce collision computation cost without diminishing accuracy. Fractal
generation is optimised with GPU instancing, enabling instant creation of intricate, scalable geometries useful for
gaming, simulations and prototyping.

The project provides huge application for efficient terrain systems which could be constructed using fractals, rendered
in a fraction of the time, require minimal storage and come instantly pre-packaged with an exponentially efficient but
still fully accurate collider, all whilst ensuring there is control over the modelling process.
